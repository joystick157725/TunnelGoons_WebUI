# TunnelGoons_WebUI
A web UI created for the tabletop roleplaying game, Tunnel Goons.

The rules of the game can be downloaded using the following link: https://natetreme.itch.io/tunnelgoons

This interactive online web UI is developed using Vue.js for the frontend frameowrk and Laravel for the backend framework. Since this application is still in development, here are the minimum requirements in order to run the following application through an IDE:
- Laravel's composer
- Node.js
- Tailwind.css
- Axios

The application can still be run on one's own localhost, yet the database still needed to be migrated.
